Hi! I'm a 2nd M.S. Student at [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.ucla.edu), UCLA Fielding School of Public Health with expected graduation date in June. After graduation, I'm going to continue my Ph.D. journey at University of California, San Diego working with [Tiffany Amariuta](https://www.amariutalab.org/). 

I'm a Quantitative Researcher in biomedical science passionate about leveraging the power of molecular diagnostics to fight cancer. With 4+ years of hands-on research experience working with experts in Biotech, National labs, Universities, and Hospitals, my career goal is to turn data into actionable insights to transform Cancer Care & revolutionize Public Health.

Now, I'm working on mediation analysis for a three-arm randomized controlled trial & a PGS-based risk stratification model in survival analysis setting at UCLA. Previously, I worked as a Biostatistician Intern in Foundation Medicine where I verified the Assay Performance for FoundationOneÂ® Liquid CDx (F1LCDx) and designed a new criteria for assay precision study.
