Hi! I'm a 2nd M.S. Student at [Department of Biostatistics](https://ph.ucla.edu/departments/biostatistics), UCLA Fielding School of Public Health with an expected graduation date in June. After graduation, I will continue my Ph.D. journey in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program at UCSD working with Prof. [Tiffany Amariuta](https://www.amariutalab.org/). 

I'm a Quantitative Researcher in biomedical science passionate about leveraging the power of molecular diagnostics to fight cancer. With 4+ years of hands-on research experience working with experts in Biotech, National labs, Universities, and Hospitals, my career goal is to turn data into actionable insights to transform Cancer Care & revolutionize Public Health.

I am particularly interested in developing novel statistical approaches to integrate genetic data across millions of individuals from diverse ancestries and improve the generalizability of disease risk models, which is necessary for the clinical implementation of personalized preventive medicine.

Here are my [Blog](https://peterntuph.github.io/home/) and [Curriculum Vitae](https://peterntuph.github.io/home/CV.pdf). Thanks for reading and taking the time to comment :)
