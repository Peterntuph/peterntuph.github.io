Hi! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology at UC San Diego working alongside Prof. [Tiffany Amariuta](https://www.amariutalab.org/). Born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan, Kuan-Hung earned a B.S. in Public Health from National Taiwan University and an M.S. in Biostatistics from UCLA.

As a quantitative researcher in the biomedical field, he is passionate about leveraging the power of molecular diagnostics to combat diseases. Further, with a deeply ingrained scientific philosophy to promote "Health for All‚Äù, he aims to transform Cancer Care and revolutionize Public Health by translating data into actionable insights.

Currently, Kuan-Hung is particularly interested in developing novel statistical approaches to integrate genetic data across millions of individuals with diverse ancestries and enhance the generalizability of disease risk models, which is necessary for the clinical implementation of personalized preventive medicine.
