I am currently a Full-time Master Student at the [Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health](https://www.biostat.ucla.edu). My research interests lie at the intersection of **Precision Medicine** and **Statistical Genetics**. My works focus on analyzing large-scale GWAS and epidemiological data to identify the genetic determinants of complex disease, including cancer, metabolic, neuropsychiatric, and aging disorders. I was fascinated by the great impact research has on shaping policies and public health decision-making and gradually form my career goal to bridging the gap between health data research and actionable insight.

Here is my [Blog](https://peterntuph.github.io/home/splash-page/) and [Curriculum Vitae](https://peterntuph.github.io/home/CV.pdf). Thanks for reading and taking the time to comment :)
