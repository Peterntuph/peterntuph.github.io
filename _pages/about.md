I am currently a full-time Master Student at [Department of Statistics, University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) supervised by Prof. [Yongjin Park](https://ypark.github.io/). My research interests lies at the intersection of **Causal Inference** and **Statistical Genetics**. My works focus on analyzing large-scale GWAS and epidemiological data to identify the genetic determinants of complex disease, including cancer, metabolic, neuropsychiatric and aging disorders. I also interested in new polygenic methods and applying these methods to genetic risk prediction. I was fascinated by the great impact research has on shaping policies and public health decision-making and gradually form my career goal to bridging the gap between health data research and interventions.
